			<h4>State of the Arts Survey 2019</h4>

			<ul class="list">
					<li>• An anonymous survey for visual artists</li>
					<li>• 100% open source / free-to-use data after completion</li>
					<li>• Collecting information to help empower artists in practical decisions</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This is a working draft for an anonymous census-style survey that would be aimed specifically at gathering information about visual artists with the intention of helping the broader visual arts community in practical decision making.</p>

			<p>The data gathered would be aggregated and made 100% public / freely accessible for artists to draw their own conclusions and insights from. Accessibility would take the form of raw cross-referenceable data as well as targeted visualizations (graphs / charts etc).</p>

			<p>This project is roughly modeled on the State of JavaScript survey’s initial 2016 iteration, which was comprised of 89 questions (taking 15-20 minutes total to complete) with 9,307 respondents. State of JS is now a critical tool for web developers with over 20,000 participants in 2018. (https://stateofjs.com/)</p>



			<h4>The Beta Survey</h4>

			<p>Before launching and promoting the official survey, we are gathering general feedback and testing survel platforms through a beta version of the survey. This survey is much shorter than the full survey and gives ample oppourtunity for input including ideas for new questions and questions that may be cut for the final version of the survey.</p>
