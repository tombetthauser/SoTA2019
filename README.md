# State of the Arts Survey

An ongoing census-style survey for visual artists. Maintained freely for artists by an artist with the help of artists. Started in 2019, overhauled after 2020 COVID hiatus. Rendered in random order for no particular reason.

Currently using a Google form with clunky csv update script for reasons of laziness. This was / is my first D3 project and will be in need of a more thorough overhaul when I am more familiar with D3. Hugely in debt to the D3 community for getting this to work at all. Specific thanks to [@mbostock](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock) for the beautiful word clouds.

Survey can be taken at any time by anyone that considers themselves an artist.
