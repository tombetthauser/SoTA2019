				<li>What cities are artists living in?</li>
				<li>How many of us are there?</li>

			<p>State of the Arts is an anonymous census-style survey intended to help artists gather and have free open access to critical information regarding trends in the arts communities of which they are a part. The goal of the survey is to assist artists in practical decision making and aid them in building a more inclusive, sustainable and vibrant art world by giving them free access to this information.</p>	
			<p>The survey is planned to remain open until the end of 2019 at which time the anonymous data gathered will be made 100% public and freely accessible for all artists to draw their own conclusions and insights from. Accessibility will take the form of raw cross-referenceable data as well as more standard graphs and charts.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Not made for profit or publicity. Built freely for artists by artists.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Who Should Take it &amp; Why?</h3>
					
			<p>The questions on this survey were designed to accomodate and serve all forms of visual artists, from art students to visual arts professors and established artists with international exhibion records.</p>
			<p>If you have ever found yourself struggling in the descision making process of changing cities, changing jobs, applying for graduate school or making any practical descision to help better support and enrich your art practice then this survey is for you.</p>
			
			<h3>If you Can, Pass it Along!</h3>
			
			<p>This survey will only be helpful to us as individuals and communities if as many of us as possible participate. Since this is a non-profit community-based project it needs your help. If you want to support the project please consider sharing it in any way possible.</p>
			
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Share it on social media</li>
				<li>Email it to your peers</li>
				<li>Tell your students or teachers</li>

			<!-- <h3>The Beta Survey:</h3>
			
			<p>Before launching the official survey a beta version has been made available to assist in gathering general feedback, ideas for additional questions etc. Responses to the beta will play a role in shaping the form the survey ultimately takes and will count towards the final survey so artists will not need to take the survey more than once.</p>
			
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Beta Survey Closes: End of August 2019</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>The Full Survey:</h3>
			
			<p>The full survey will be adjusted and added to based on the responses collected in the beta survey. Once launched it will be open for any artist to take anonymously until the end of the year with the data being made open and freely accessible to artists in early 2020.</p>
			
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Full Survey Opens: September 2019</li>
			</ul> -->
			
			<h3>Plans for Open Source:</h3>
			
			<p>When the 2019 survey is complete, all the anonymous data collected and the platform built for displaying that data will be made 100% open source for artists to freely access and use in any way they see fit. Additionally as an open source project, artists will be welcome to participate in the development of the codebase and the survey questions for future years.</p>

			<ul class="list">
				<li>Data gathered will be made 100% open and free to use for all artists</li>
				<li>Check out our open code repository on <a target="new" href="https://github.com/tombetthauser/stateofthearts">GitHub</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>For the time being this landing page constitutes the extent of the open-source wing of the project while the survey itself is temporarily managed through Google Forms which is free but unfortunately not open source. After the survey is complete and in future iterations a fully open source survey platform will be implemented.</p>
