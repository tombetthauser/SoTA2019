          <p class="intro-title-p">Welcome to the State of the Arts 2019 survey results!</p>
          <p>State of the Arts is <strong>an anonymous census-style survey for visual artists</strong> intended to help artists
            gather and have free open
            access to critical information regarding trends in the arts communities of which they are a part. The goal of the
            survey is
            to assist artists in practical decision making and aid them in building a more inclusive, sustainable and vibrant art
            world by giving them free access to this information.</p>
          <p>The <strong>2019</strong> iteration of the survey was organized with the assistance of a small group of graduates
            from the San
            Francisco Art Institute and the Yale School of Art. It is comprised of <strong>89 questions</strong> including but not
            limited to those that addressed the following.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What <strong>cities</strong> are artists living in?</li>
            <li>What kinds of <strong>jobs</strong> are we working?</li>
            <li>What <strong>subjects</strong> are we making work about?</li>
            <li>What <strong>mediums</strong> are we using?</li>
            <li>How are we <strong>selling</strong> our work?</li>
            <li>How are we <strong>getting shows</strong> ?</li>
            <li>How are we <strong>connecting</strong> with eachother?</li>
            <li>In what ways are we <strong>struggling</strong> ?</li>
            <li>In what ways are we <strong>thriving</strong> ?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For this first beta version of the survey we are proud to have had <strong>over 100 participants</strong> from across
            the United States that took the
            survey before December 31st 2019. <strong>Participation is still welcome</strong> however if you wish to fill out the
            survey please do so with information from your 2019 studio year.
          </p>

            <strong>As you explore the results</strong> please keep in mind, the intention was for this to be <strong>an open-ended survey.</strong> Our contributors made the 
            sincerest effort to make sure there was no singular agenda or bias at work in the selection of questions. The presentation for the data is
            intended to be similarly neutral. <strong>It's up to the reader to decide what the data might mean</strong> and what conclusions to
            draw.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have fun, take everything with a big grain of salt, when in doubt check out the raw data and <strong>if you find anything interesting</strong> 
            like correlations or unexpected trends please <strong>share it on social media</strong> using <strong>#SotA2019</strong> or

              The <strong>size of words</strong> correlates directly to the <strong>number of survey participants</strong> that listed a given word in their response. Artists were
              asked to fill in <strong>any words to describe the subject matter and mediums they used</strong> in their studios during 2019. 
            </p><p>
              You will find a number of other word clouds as you review the rest of the data visualizations from the survey. They can be helpful and easy to digest visually but if 
              you are interested in seeing more specific information regarding responses keep in mind that <strong>the raw data from the survey is freely available for download</strong>, and you
              are strongly encouraged to explore it as well. There are an infinite number of insights to be gained by cross-referencing responses and exploring the information in different formats.
