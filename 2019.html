			<h3>State of the Arts Survey:</h3>
		</div>
		<div id="container-02" class="p-normal">

			<ul class="list">
				<li>What cities are artists moving to?</li>
				<li>What kinds of jobs are we working?</li>
				<li>How are we sharing our artwork?</li>
				<li>How can we better support ourselves?</li>
				<li>In what ways are we struggling?</li>
				<li>In what ways are we thriving?</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>State of the Arts is an anonymous census-style survey intended to help artists gather and have free open access to
			critical information regarding trends in the arts communities of which they are a part. The goal of the survey is to
			assist artists in practical decision making and aid them in building a more inclusive, sustainable and vibrant art
			world by giving them free access to this information.</p>	
			<p>The survey will remain open until the end of 2019 at which time the anonymous data gathered will be made 100% public
			and freely accessible for all artists to draw their own conclusions and insights from. Accessibility will take the form
			of raw cross-referenceable data as well as more standard graphs and charts.</p>
			<p>
				As this is the first year the survey has been made available it is being 
				approaced as a fully functional beta version. Significant changes may be 
				implemented for the 2020 version based on the input of surveyed artists.
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Not made for profit or publicity. Built freely for artists by artists.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Who Should Take It &amp; Why?</h3>
					
			<p>The questions on this survey were designed to serve all forms of visual artists, from art students to visual arts
			professors and established artists with international exhibition records.</p>
			<p>If you have ever found yourself struggling in the decision making process of changing cities, changing jobs, applying
			for graduate school or making any practical decision to help better support and enrich your art practice, then this
			survey is for you.</p>
			
			<h3>If You Can, Pass It Along!</h3>
			
			<p>This survey will only be helpful to us as individuals and communities if as many of us as possible participate. Since
			this is a non-profit community-based project it needs your help. If you want to support the project please consider
			passing it along!</p>
			
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Share it on social media</li>
				<li>Email it to your peers</li>
				<li>Tell your students or teachers</li>

			</ul>

			
			<h3>Free-to-Use Data:</h3>
			
			<p>When the 2019 survey is complete, all the anonymous data collected will be made 100% open for artists, 
			artist-run galleries and non-profit arts organizations to freely access and use. Future iterations of the 
			project are planned to be fully open source and artists will be encouraged to participate in the development 
			of future survey questions.</p>

			<ul class="list">
				<li>Data gathered will be made 100% open and free to use for all artists</li>
				<li>Check out our open repository on <a target="new" href="https://github.com/tombetthauser/stateofthearts">GitHub</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>For the time being this landing page constitutes the extent of the open-source wing of the project while the survey
			itself is temporarily managed through Google Forms which is free but unfortunately not open source. After the beta survey is
			complete a fully open source survey platform is planned for implementation.</p>


			<h3>Who Made This &amp; Why?</h3>
			
			<p>
				SotA was originally organized, edited and built by a group of graduates from the Yale University School of Art and the 
				San Francisco Art Institute working across the US as adjunct and full-time visual arts and art history instructors. 
				It's original intention was to help practicing artists and art students better understand the art world they are a part of and 
				make practical deciscions that better serve the long-term health of their art practices.
