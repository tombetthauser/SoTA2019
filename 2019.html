			<ul class="list">
					<li>An anonymous survey for visual artists</li>
					<li>Questions focus on details of art practice from the past year</li>
					<li>Designed to help artists in practical decision making</li>
					<li>Data gathered will be made 100% open and free to use for all artists</li>
			</ul>

			<p>State of the Arts is an anonymous census-style survey intended to help artists gather and have free open access to critical information regarding trends in the arts communities of which they are a part. The goal of the survey is to assist artists in practical decision making and aid them in building a more inclusive, sustainable and vibrant art world.</p>

			<p>The survey is planned to remain open until the end of 2019 at which time the anonymous data gathered will be made 100% public and freely accessible for all artists to draw their own conclusions and insights from. Accessibility will take the form of raw cross-referenceable data as well as targeted visualizations (graphs / charts etc).</p>

			<h3>The Beta Survey:</h3>

			<p>Before launching the official survey a beta version has been made available to assist in gathering general feedback, ideas for additional questions etc. Responses to the beta will play a role in shaping the form the survey ultimately takes and will count towards the final survey so artists will not need to take the survey more than once.</p>

			<ul class="list">
					<li>Beta Survey Closes: End of August 2019</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>The Full Survey:</h3>

			<p>The full survey will be adjusted and added to based on the responses collected in the beta survey. Once launched it will be open for any artist to take anonymously until the end of the year with the data being made open and freely accessible to artists in early 2020.</p>

			<ul class="list">
					<li>Full Survey Opens: September 2019</li>
